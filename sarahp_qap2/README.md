1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)


Answer: I worked on it over 2+ days. 


2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

Answer: your lectures, datacamp (https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1665049611/Marketing/Blog/Regular_Expressions_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), chatGPT for remembering ternary operator and extracting information from a dictionary. 


3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Answer: No, but I usually do. 

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

Answer: No


5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.


Answer: I feel confident I could do it with reference material. I think I would need to do it a few more times to be confident otherwise. But I think with a little more practice I could also do this much more quickly.
